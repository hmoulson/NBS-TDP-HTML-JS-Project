# NBS-TDP-HTML-JS-Project
HTML and JavaScript QA Project for TDP

<b> •	Why are we doing this? : </b> <br>
The internet is increasingly becoming the host enviornment for applications and programs as opposed to downloading it on your local drive. Being able to build effective web applications is therefore a critical and valuable skill and it is necessary to understand how to utilise the HTML, CSS and JS languages collectively to develop cohesive sites drawing the best from each language.

<b> •	How I expected the challenge to go : </b> <br>
The expectation was that achieving a simple HTML and JavaScript setup would be relatively simple but that reaching higher levels of functionality and the of an inclusion CSS StyleSheet would introduce potentially numerous and significant challenges.

The minimum viable product was defined as having a HTML heavy design and toggling the visibility settings on each element to achieve a clean page. Improved functionality was identified as a toggle towards a JavaScript driven page with heavy use of elements created at RunTime and a limited HTML-file focused more on triggering the JS functions. CSS was called for in further stretches to improve the look of the page, however this was not expected to be heavily used for reasons derived from the time constraint and previous lack of user experience.  

<b> •	What went well? : </b> <br>
The heavy use of "createElement" proved to be successful and the html page achieved the clean, functional, and simple UI design required and preferred. This meant that only a single / display entry form "the NI Number Search form" had toggling visibility which was as per the plan.

The integration of CSS, JavaScript Code, a JavaScript JSON Array and HTML all proved to be successful and significantly fewer than expected challenges were encountered.

<b> •	What didn't go as planned? : </b> <br>
The original plan was for the edit screen to be hosted in a popup form triggered by the Edit buttons included in the build. This proved to be unreliable and troubleshooting these challenges did not succeed in identifying and solving the causes. A fallback option of using JavaScript created Elements proved to be a successful replacement.

CSS development did not proceed as far as liked due to time constraints however, the core functionality required from CSS for the Minimum Viable Product design was achieved.

Attempts were made to make the page size responsive with ability to resize as the user increased and decreased zoom and this proved partially successful. At zooms of 125% or greater the methodology failed, and due to my limited understanding of the CSS script, I was not able to remedy or correct the problem.  

<b> •	Possible improvements for future : </b> <br>
Improvements to the CSS are possible to improve visual and accessibility factors. Likewise improvements are possible to the add and update forms to remove ability for user to add records with incomplete field information aand to equally be able to flag errors directly using created Elements. Likewise, adjusting the Department input on the edit screen to show as radio button selectors would be ideal. The alternative would be to either add etry restrictions or make the filter dynamicly updating to reflect any new entries beyond the baseline offerings for IT, Sales and HR.
