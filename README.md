HTML and JavaScript QA Project for TDP

•	Why are we doing this?


•	How I expected the challenge to go.


•	What went well?


•	What didn't go as planned?


•	Possible improvements for future : <br>
Improvements to the CSS are possible to improve visual and accessibility factors. Likewise improvements are possible to the add and update forms to remove ability for user to add records with incomplete field information aand to equally be able to flag errors directly using created Elements. Likewise, adjusting the Department input on the edit screen to show as radio button selectors would be ideal. The alternative would be to either add etry restrictions or make the filter dynamicly updating to reflect any new entries beyond the baseline offerings for IT, Sales and HR.
